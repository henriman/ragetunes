Export generated playlists (and playlists in general) to Spotify by creating and updating a Spotify playlist using the Spotify API, if possible. 

Would be cool if it also works with local files (i.e. to then choose the appropriate local files that Spotify sees to put in a playlist).

The playlists can be generated e.g. from set operations on [[Tag organization|tags]].
