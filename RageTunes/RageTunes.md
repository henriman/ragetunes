**RageTunes** is supposed to be an application to organize your digital music library, with an integrated music player for various sources.

The main feature to improve organization are *tags*. Instead of ordering songs, albums, artists etc. purely hierarchically using e.g. a folder structure, an element can have multiple independent tags.

Other (proposed) features are listed in the [[Feature list|feature list]]. Also see the [[Roadmap|roadmap]].
