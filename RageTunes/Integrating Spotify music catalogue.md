Use the Spotify API to browse and save music (songs, albums, playlists, artists etc.), if possible. Should also integrate with [[Tag organization|tags]].

Further ideas:
- Link artists on Spotify with local artists s.t. e.g. in the case where you have an artist with some of their albums not on Spotify, you could download them and play them locally, but if you browse for the artist you can see both their Spotify and local albums in one place.
