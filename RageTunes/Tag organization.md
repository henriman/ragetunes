# Description

- Songs, albums, playlists, artists can be given multiple *tags*
	- E.g. to sort into genre (metal, rock) or mood (aggressive, mellow)
- The music library can then filtered by these tags
	- By using set operators such as union, intersection, difference
- Playlists can be generated from these combinations of tags
	- And ultimately loaded into Spotify
- Tags can be given descriptions 

# Additional ideas

- tags have folder structure
	- e.g. sub-genre (black metal) is under genre (metal)
	- or maybe "directed tree" structure (metalcore is child of hardcore and metal)
	- but then be careful when showing tags: show also children with other parents?
